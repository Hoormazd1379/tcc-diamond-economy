## üéÆ **HOW THE CHEST SHOP SYSTEM WORKS**

### **For Shop Owners:**
1. Place a trapped chest where you want your shop
2. Look at the chest and run `/createshop <price>` (e.g., `/createshop 5`)
3. Fill your chest with items you want to sell
4. Players will pay the specified price PER ITEM when they take things
5. You get paid automatically when items are purchased
6. You can access your shop normally to restock or take items out
7. Use `/listshops` to see all your shops
8. Use `/removeshop` while looking at a shop to remove it

### **For Customers:**
1. Approach a chest shop (look for golden particles)
2. Right-click to open the **Shop Browser** (NOT a chest interface)
3. Browse items with displayed prices (e.g., "Diamond Sword - 10üíé each")
4. **Left-click** an item to buy 1 unit
5. **Right-click** an item to buy the full stack (or maximum you can afford)
6. Items automatically go to your inventory if you have space and diamonds
7. See real-time balance updates and purchase confirmations

### **Protection Features:**
- Shop chests have golden particle effects
- Only owners can break shop chests
- Hoppers cannot steal from shops
- Automatic balance validation prevents overspending
- Shop data persists across server restarts

## üìä **DATA STORAGE**

New file created: `server-folder/diamond_economy/chest_shops.json`

Example shop data:
```json
{
  "minecraft:overworld:100:64:-200": {
    "ownerUUID": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "ownerName": "Steve",
    "worldName": "minecraft:overworld",
    "x": 100,
    "y": 64,
    "z": -200,
    "pricePerItem": 10,
    "createdTime": 1642781234567
  }
}
```

## üéØ **TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **Basic Shop Creation**: Create shops with different prices
2. **Multi-Player Trading**: Have different players create and use shops
3. **Protection Testing**: Try to break others' shops, test hopper protection
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with full inventories, insufficient funds
5. **Persistence**: Restart server and verify shops remain

## üîß **ISSUE RESOLUTION SUMMARY:**

### ‚úÖ **1. Customer Access Issue - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Customers were blocked from opening shop chests
- **Solution**: Modified event handler to allow chest opening while providing shop info
- **Result**: Customers can now properly open and interact with shop chests

### ‚úÖ **2. Particle Effects Issue - FIXED** 
- **Problem**: Particles only appeared on interaction
- **Solution**: Created `ShopParticleManager` with server tick events for continuous spawning
- **Result**: Golden sparkles + happy villager particles continuously spawn around all shops (every second)

### ‚úÖ **6. MAJOR: Custom Shop Browser GUI - IMPLEMENTED**
- **Requirement**: Customers should see a dedicated shop browsing interface, not a chest GUI
- **Solution**: Created `ShopBrowserScreenHandler` with custom shopping interface that displays items with prices
- **Features**: Left-click to buy 1, right-click to buy full stack, real-time price display, professional shopping experience
- **Result**: Customers now get a true shop browsing experience with the owner's name in the title

### ‚úÖ **5. Customer Access Blocking - FIXED**
- **Problem**: ActionResult.SUCCESS was preventing customers from opening shops at all
- **Solution**: Used server execution scheduling to open custom shop interface after allowing the initial interaction
- **Result**: Customers can now open shops and see the custom shopping interface properly

### ‚úÖ **4. CRITICAL: Payment Enforcement - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Customers could take items from shops without paying, essentially allowing free theft
- **Solution**: Implemented custom `ShopScreenHandler` with enforced payment system and slot interaction override
- **Result**: Customers can only acquire items through the purchase system - no more free theft possible

### ‚úÖ **3. Mixin Issues - FULLY RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: Multiple mixin errors causing server crashes - first invalid method targeting, then parameter signature mismatches
- **Solution**: Removed the problematic `ChestBlockEntityMixin` entirely since it was only for cosmetic GUI title enhancement
- **Result**: Server now starts reliably without any mixin errors, all core chest shop functionality preserved

### üìù **Design Decision:**
- **Payment Security**: Prioritized secure payment enforcement over cosmetic features
- **Custom Interface**: Customers now get a proper shopping interface that shows shop title "üè™ [Owner]'s Shop"
- **Future**: Additional cosmetic enhancements can be added while maintaining the secure payment system

## üéÆ **HOW IT WORKS NOW:**

1. **Shop Creation**: Place trapped chest ‚Üí `/createshop 10` ‚Üí Continuous particles appear
2. **Customer Experience**: Approach shop ‚Üí See continuous golden particles ‚Üí Open chest ‚Üí **Custom Shop Browser opens** ‚Üí See items with prices ‚Üí Left-click to buy 1, right-click to buy stack
3. **Owner Experience**: Open your shop ‚Üí Normal chest interface ‚Üí Manage inventory normally
4. **Visual Identity**: All shops have constant particle effects making them easily identifiable
5. **Professional Shopping**: Customers get a real shop experience with proper GUI showing owner name and item prices

**Note**: Customers now see a dedicated **Shop Browser** with owner's name in title and individual item pricing - completely separate from chest interface!

Your chest shop system is now **enterprise-grade with professional shopping experience**! üöÄ
